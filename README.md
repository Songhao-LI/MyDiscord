# MyDiscord

## Project Introduction

**Project Name:** MyDiscord

**Objective:** A Nested Comments System for connection among local residents, inspired by the functionality and community interaction model of Discord.

This project aims to create an online platform where residents of specific neighborhoods can engage in discussions, share local news, and build community ties through a structured, nested commenting system.

## Suggested Key Features

1. **User Registration and Profiles:** Allow users to sign up, create profiles, and add personal details along with optional photos to foster a sense of community.

2. **Nested Comments:** Enable users to reply directly to comments in a structured manner, facilitating organized discussions and easier navigation through conversation threads.

3. **Neighborhood and Block Identification:** Users can identify their neighborhood and block to see localized content and discussions relevant to their specific area.

4. **Private and Group Messaging:** Just like Discord, provide options for private messaging and group discussions, allowing users to have both public and private conversations.

5. **Notification System:** Implement a system to notify users about new comments, messages, or threads in their neighborhoods or any specified area of interest.

6. **Customizable User Settings:** Allow users to customize settings for privacy, notifications, and content preferences to enhance user experience and comfort.

7. **Event Planning and Local Ads:** Facilitate the organization of local events and allow members to post advertisements, fostering local business and community activities.

8. **Mobile and Web Accessibility:** Ensure the platform is accessible via both web and mobile applications, providing seamless communication across different devices.
